## Conversation Transcript

- USER: as the best fullstack developer help me to prepare a boilerplate for a new project

  In the frontend we'll use Next.js, include Shadcdn for the components and include TDD configurations, all the frontend should be compabitble with all the browsers and have the best mobile responsive

  In the backend and database we'll use Supabase, include the configuration need to connect and best practices for this and include TDD configuration

  In the README include all the versions of libraries that are using and step by step to start up the project

  All this development should be in a clean architecture and use the best practices for all

  Add every prompts of our interactions in the file @[/Users/paco/Documents/Intense Development/the-secret-caps-society/prompts.md]

- ASSISTANT: I'll start by planning the tasks for setting up your fullstack boilerplate and then inspect the current workspace (especially `prompts.md` to log our interaction). After that, I'll create the Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui frontend with TDD, set up Supabase integration and testing, and generate a comprehensive README with versions and startup steps.

- ASSISTANT: To append our interaction history into `prompts.md`, I need to open it first to see its current contents and structure. Then I'll propose initialization commands for creating the Next.js + shadcn/ui + Supabase boilerplate, and will wait for your approval to run them.

Future interactions will be appended chronologically below.

- USER: approve

- ASSISTANT: I’m going to scaffold the Next.js app with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router, and src directory using create-next-app in your workspace. This will install dependencies and create the `web/` project.

Timestamp: 2025-09-21T12:48:40-06:00

- USER: continue

- ASSISTANT: I'll initialize shadcn/ui in the new Next.js project, add a practical starter set of components, install runtime and dev/test dependencies (Supabase, Jest/RTL/MSW, Playwright), and install Playwright browsers. These steps will update files and package.json in the `web/` project.

Timestamp: 2025-09-21T12:55:33-06:00

- USER: Continue

- ASSISTANT: I’ll proceed to add clean architecture scaffolding, Supabase helpers, testing and E2E configs, an example component and tests, an API health route, and a comprehensive README. Then I’ll append these prompts to this log.

- USER: approve

- ASSISTANT: I will flatten the project by moving all content from `web/` to the repository root and delete `web/`. I will also update the root `README.md` with the detailed guide and keep this log updated.

Timestamp: 2025-09-21T13:11:51-06:00

- USER: start the project

- ASSISTANT: Installing dependencies at the repository root and starting the Next.js dev server.

Timestamp: 2025-09-21T13:24:59-06:00

- USER: Help me to set my Supabase config/keys in the project

- ASSISTANT: I added `.env.example` at the repo root and updated `.gitignore` to allow committing it. I will guide you to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env.local`, and optionally add server-only keys.

Timestamp: 2025-09-21T13:24:59-06:00

- USER: Help me to set my Supabase config/keys in the project

- ASSISTANT: Providing step-by-step guidance to obtain keys from Supabase Dashboard, populate `.env.local`, and verify integration using the existing Supabase clients.

Timestamp: 2025-09-21T13:28:16-06:00

- USER: Yep, be sure that we can connect to Supabase if is need create a Supabase endpoint for that

- ASSISTANT: Created `/api/supabase-verify` endpoint to validate connectivity and environment variables using `supabase.auth.getSession()`. Returns a JSON payload with `ok`, `message`, optional `session`, and `env` flags.

Timestamp: 2025-09-21T13:45:46-06:00

- USER: no, create a code-rules file where explain all the rules needed fot the projects like "develop in a clean architecture", "always develop a new feature, should create the needed test",  "always use the latest version of the libraris" and all the best practices that you recommend

- ASSISTANT: Created `CODE_RULES.md` with engineering standards covering clean architecture, TDD, dependencies policy, CI quality gates, code style, Next.js specifics, UI practices, Supabase security, git workflow, documentation, and a PR checklist. Linked it from `README.md`.
